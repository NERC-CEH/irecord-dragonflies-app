10,Coenagrion mercuriale,Southern Damselfly,zygoptera,,"The Southern Damselfly, Coenagrion mercuriale, is one of five members of the genus Coenagrion currently to be found in the British Isles (two others have gone extinct in the last 40 years) and one of eleven members of the family Coenagrionidae. C. mercuriale mercury markThe Southern Damselfly, Coenagrion mercuriale, is one of five members of the genus Coenagrion currently to be found in the British Isles (two others have gone extinct in the last 40 years) and one of eleven members of the family Coenagrionidae. Together with Common Blue Damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum) and White-legged Damselfly (Platycnemis pennipes), the Coenagrion species constitute the blue damselflies, which are all blue and black in colour. Male Southern Damselflies can only be identified from examination of the anal appendages, though the mercury mark on the second abdominal segment is a useful guide. Female Coenagrion species are very similar making them difficult to identify. Adults are on the wing from mid May to August. The flight is weak and low; they stay close to the breeding site and do not appear to disperse easily to colonise new areas. Low shrubs and Juncus spp. are used for perching, roosting and feeding forays. Eggs are laid in submerged tissues of aquatic and emergent vegetation and the plant dwelling larvae usually take two years to mature. The larvae are distinctive in that they have very small, un-patterned caudal lamellae.","In the UK the Southern Damselfly is primarily a species of base-rich runnels and streams often within acid heathland areas. However, it also occurs on water meadows in the flood plains of two chalk rivers, a habitat said to be more typical of many continental sites. At breeding sites the water is typically shallow and slow-flowing over a gravel or marl bed with patches of organic detritus. It may be that a more or less constant, relatively high, water temperature in winter in the spring-fed sites is particularly important in determining site suitability.","The Southern Damselfly is a rare species in the UK. In the UK, it is living on the extreme north-western fringe of its European range. Its two main strongholds are in the New Forest, Hampshire and the Preseli mountains, Pembrokeshire. Smaller colonies are found in Devon, Dorset, Anglesey, Gower, Oxfordshire and on the flood plains of the Test and Itchen rivers in Hampshire. There are old records from Cornwall and Somerset and elsewhere in Devon, Dorset and South Wales. The range of the species has contracted in the last thirty years.","11, 14 and melanogastrum form of the 8 (out of area 9, 13).",images/Coenagrion_mercuriale_m_Helder_Conceic_a_o.jpg,C.

It appears to prefer early successional habitats with minimal vegetation, although some emergent plants are required at breeding sites. A common feature of most sites is a degree of habitat disturbance, which maintains bare substrate, and the openness of the vegetation","I. pumilio is classed as nationally scarce in the British Red Data Book of Insects. At the turn of the century it was thought to be extinct, but in recent times has shown some range expansion.

Larvae also occur among waterlogged Sphagnum in depressions devoid of standing water. The larvae live within the matrix of submerged and floating Sphagnum and are confined to waters without fish. Away from its aquatic habitat it also requires scrub or woodland, which provides important roosting and feeding sites.",In Britain the 35 is found at isolated sites from the Midlands to north Scotland and Chartley Moss is currently the most southerly site in the UK.
