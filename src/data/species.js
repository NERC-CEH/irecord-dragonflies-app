There was also a record of a male, perhaps an immigrant, from Strumpshaw in Norfolk.    2013 - Southern Migrant Hawker: There are suggestions that this species may usually have a 2-year life-cycle in Britain, and after the good showing during 2012 last year might have been anticipated to be an \u201coff-year\u201d for this recent colonist. Indeed there were to be much lower numbers reported than during 2012, but pleasingly the species was still seen at several sites. These included Hadleigh Country Park, Wat Tyler Country Park, Canvey Marshes and Canvey Wick in southern Essex, and Cliffe Marshes in northern Kent.    2014 - Southern Migrant Hawker: Individuals were reported from many of the species\u2019 key sites in the Thames Estuary area, with additional records in Essex from Rainham Marshes and Chafford Gorges Nature Reserve. While records in north Kent were relatively substantive, the Essex sightings however generally referred to just single individuals seen on single dates.",

Synchronised emergence usually begins towards the end of May, and adults can be seen on the wing until early August."

C. mercuriale mercury markThe Southern Damselfly, Coenagrion mercuriale, is one of five members of the genus Coenagrion currently to be found in the British Isles (two others have gone extinct in the last 40 years) and one of eleven members of the family Coenagrionidae. Together with Common Blue Damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum) and White-legged Damselfly (Platycnemis pennipes), the Coenagrion species constitute the blue damselflies, which are all blue and black in colour. Male Southern Damselflies can only be identified from examination of the anal appendages, though the mercury mark on the second abdominal segment is a useful guide. Female Coenagrion species are very similar making them difficult to identify. Adults are on the wing from mid May to August. The flight is weak and low; they stay close to the breeding site and do not appear to disperse easily to colonise new areas. Low shrubs and Juncus spp. are used for perching, roosting and feeding forays.    Eggs are laid in submerged tissues of aquatic and emergent vegetation and the plant dwelling larvae usually take two years to mature. The larvae are distinctive in that they have very small, un-patterned caudal lamellae."

    "description": "In many ways this could be considered to be the most typical British damselfly. It shares its blue and black colouration with several other species. It can be distinguished from the others by its broad ante-humeral stripes. In the male, S2 has a characteristic mark of a spot linked to the inter segment suture by a short line. S8 and S9 are entirely blue.  The female occurs in two colour forms, one blue, as in the male, the other dull green. The mark on S2 is thistle shaped and there is a \"Christmas tree\" shaped stepped triangle on S8.  They often perch gregariously on emergent plant stems, all facing the same way."

Identification can be difficult as there are often age related colour changes in this species that are not always described in the literature."
