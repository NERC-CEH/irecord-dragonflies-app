C. mercuriale mercury markThe Southern Damselfly, Coenagrion mercuriale, is one of five members of the genus Coenagrion currently to be found in the British Isles (two others have gone extinct in the last 40 years) and one of eleven members of the family Coenagrionidae. Together with Common Blue Damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum) and White-legged Damselfly (Platycnemis pennipes), the Coenagrion species constitute the blue damselflies, which are all blue and black in colour. Male Southern Damselflies can only be identified from examination of the anal appendages, though the mercury mark on the second abdominal segment is a useful guide. Female Coenagrion species are very similar making them difficult to identify. Adults are on the wing from mid May to August. The flight is weak and low; they stay close to the breeding site and do not appear to disperse easily to colonise new areas. Low shrubs and Juncus spp. are used for perching, roosting and feeding forays.    Eggs are laid in submerged tissues of aquatic and emergent vegetation and the plant dwelling larvae usually take two years to mature. The larvae are distinctive in that they have very small, un-patterned caudal lamellae.", 
    "habitat": "In the UK the Southern Damselfly is primarily a species of base-rich runnels and streams often within acid heathland areas. However, it also occurs on water meadows in the flood plains of two chalk rivers, a habitat said to be more typical of many continental sites. At breeding sites the water is typically shallow and slow-flowing over a gravel or marl bed with patches of organic detritus. It may be that a more or less constant, relatively high, water temperature in winter in the spring-fed sites is particularly important in determining site suitability.",

    "description": "The Scarce Blue-tailed is one of a number of small British Damselflies. Typically Males have a black abdomen with green or blue sides and a small patch of blue near the tip covering segments eight and nine. Females are either greeny-brown when mature or bright orange in the immature aurantiaca phase. Identification can be difficult as there are often age related colour changes in this species that are not always described in the literature.", 
    "habitat": "I. pumilio is usually found in shallow wetland sites such as bog pools or slow flowing water, fed by seepages and flushes. It appears to prefer early successional habitats with minimal vegetation, although some emergent plants are required at breeding sites. A common feature of most sites is a degree of habitat disturbance, which maintains bare substrate, and the openness of the vegetation",

Indeed there were to be much lower numbers reported than during 2012, but pleasingly the species was still seen at several sites. These included Hadleigh Country Park, Wat Tyler Country Park, Canvey Marshes and Canvey Wick in southern Essex, and Cliffe Marshes in northern Kent.    2014 - Southern Migrant Hawker: Individuals were reported from many of the species\u2019 key sites in the Thames Estuary area, with additional records in Essex from Rainham Marshes and Chafford Gorges Nature Reserve.

    "description": "The White-faced Darter is a small dark dragonfly, with a pale creamy white frons. The wings have small black patches at the base and dark brown pterostigma.  The male has a narrow black abdomen, marked with red and orange on the dorsal and lateral segments. The thorax is black with faint red antehumeral stripes and lateral markings.  The female is patterned like the male but yellow replaces the red markings.", 
    "habitat": "The White Faced Darter is a species of lowland peatbogs. It requires relatively deep, oligotrophic, acidic bog pools with considerable rafts of Sphagnum at the edges in which to breed. Larvae also occur among waterlogged Sphagnum in depressions devoid of standing water. The larvae live within the matrix of submerged and floating sphagnum and are confined to waters without fish. Away from its aquatic habitat it also requires scrub or woodland, which provides important roosting and feeding sites.",

Synchronised emergence usually begins towards the end of May, and adults can be seen on the wing until early August.", 
    "habitat": "The Scarce Chaser is a species of Lowland river floodplains and usually inhabits slow-flowing, meandering rivers and large dykes. Occasionally mature gravel pits and nearby ponds also support populations. Inhabited sites characteristically have good water quality, which supports submerged and floating plants as well as prolific stands of emergent vegetation. Ovipositing females require areas of slow flowing open water, and the adults require some shrub or tree shelter.",
