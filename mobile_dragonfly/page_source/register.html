        <p>Registering with iRecord is quick and easy and makes submitting biological records much easier. It provides you with a means of viewing all the records you have submitted and accessing feedback on them, as well as allowing you to view others’ records. You can also download all of your records here.</p>

        <p>It is important that you <a target="_blank" rel="external" href="http://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord/">register with iRecord</a> before submitting mammal records through this app, as this is the database where all of The Mammal Society’s records are stored for use in atlases and ultimately mammal conservation. Records that are available on iRecord are also much more likely to be used by other organisations interested in using them for conservation and research (such as Environmental Local Record Centres).</p>

        <p>By using iRecord, you agree to these Terms and Conditions of Use. If you do not agree, please do not use the site.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>When you use iRecord, you create and upload content - for instance, wildlife observations, photos of
                nature, your descriptions of it, and messages to the forums. By putting this information on the
                site, you are saying that:
                <br/>
                a: the content is yours, or you have the permission of the owner to agree to this usage, and<br/>
                b: you agree that the content can be used on this site, and<br/>
                c: you agree that your wildlife observations can be made publicly available for wider use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wildlife observations collected through this site will be stored securely at the Biological Records
                Centre and made available to experts for verification.
            </li>
            <li>Verified observations will be made publicly available via the NBN Gateway in a dataset administered
                by the Biological Records Centre and/or the relevant national recording scheme. If you do not want
                your observations to be made available in this way, please do not submit them.
            </li>
            <li>Once verified records have been made publicly available, their use will be governed by the NBN
                Gateway Terms and Conditions, e.g. use of the data for commercial purposes will not be allowed
                without written permission from the organisation administering the dataset.
            </li>
            <li>Please do not submit records to this site that have already been submitted to a Vice County
                Recorder, Local Records Centre, National Recording Scheme or another online wildlife recording
                system.
            </li>
            <li>Having submitted a record to this site, please do not submit it to other organisations or online
                recording schemes. It will be made available to local records centres, conservation organisations,
                natural history societies and others with a legitimate interest in the data via the NBN Gateway.
            </li>
            <li>You may view wildlife renavbarcords submitted to this website by other users, but you may not store them,
                republish them, exploit them for commercial or academic research purposes, or pass them on to any
                third party.
            </li>
            <li>Your contact details will be held in a database at the Biological Records Centre and will only be
                used to contact you if there is a query about the verification of your wildlife observations.
            </li>
            <li>Your contact details will not be passed on to any third parties without your permission.
            </li>
            <li>Your name will be stored as part of the record and may be made publicly available via the NBN
                Gateway along with the species name, date and location of the record.
            </li>
            <li>If you submit a record of a species that could be vulnerable to disturbance or persecution if the
                record is made publicly available, the record will be flagged as ‘sensitive’ and will not be made
                publicly available.
